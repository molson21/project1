                <h2>A little about me:</h2>
                    <p id="content">I have had the privilege of being a part of Bellevue College since 2003, initially as an instructor for Continuing Education, which has now evolved into the Tombolo Institute. My journey began by teaching 3D animation using Maya, but over time, I have expanded my role to encompass a diverse array of courses within the Graphic Design Certificate Program. In addition to my role at the college, Iâ€™m also a seasoned commercial graphic designer, running my own freelance company. In 2022, I embarked on a new chapter in my career by venturing into eLearning, driven by my passion for crafting immersive and impactful learning experiences. I acquired my certification in Instructional Design from Oregon State University, equipping me with the skills to merge cutting-edge technology with precise performance objectives.</p>
